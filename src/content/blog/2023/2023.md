A whole lot has changed since this time last year.

I made many decisions, bad and good.

I came out as a transgender woman and started liking how I looked for the first time in… a very long while. After several months of never-ending headaches, I found out I had eye strain and got glasses.

(please take care of your sight, eye strain sucks)

I said goodbye to people and re-connected to others.

## So, what happens next?

I’m keeping my 3 resolutions from the past few years:

- Improve yourself and the world.
- Don’t make stupid decisions.
- [Don’t be an asshole](https://asshole.fyi).

But this year I’m adding a new one: Stick to it.

I am a chronic project hopper.

I start the Git repo with all the energy in the world but after the first-second hour, I give up on it.

So, I’m nipping it in the bud (hopefully). I’ve got a bunch of things that I want to smash through so I’m going to hit the ground running.

Hopefully I’ll complete them all (again) this year.

Either way, I hope you all have a wonderful year!

See you when the sun rises.
