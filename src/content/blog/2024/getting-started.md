I am terrible at finishing projects. Currently, I have uhh *counts* about 20 things in various states of disarray spanning multiple years.

But I keep making new projects, I start but I never finish.
At the start of this year, I gave myself the challenge of writing a blog post a week for a year. That lasted 2 weeks, and it was still the most successful sprint of blogging I've ever had. (better than 2 years I suppose)

So when [Annie Greens](https://anniegreens.lol) set up [WeblogPoMo](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024), I decided to jump on the idea, cause I miss writing blog posts.

I don't particularly have a theme, and I've only got 8 days worth of topics planned, so this may just become absolute nonsense by day 10.
I also have an english exam this month, so I might sit out that day, as I probably won't want to write anything that day.

I'll be tagging my posts on here with [#wbpm](/blog/t/wbpm), and my Mastodon feed with #WeblogPoMo.

Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow for the second day? :D
