title: socialising, lol
subtitle: people can be good sometimes

I've been moderating social.lol (along with the other great people on staff.lol) since August 2022.

It's probably one of the things I'm most proud of.

Out of the 403 reports we've dealt with, only 25 or so are for a local account (and one was me reporting myself, to test something)

The thing I'm most proud of is the community of nice people we've managed to cultivate.

I can't take credit for most of that though, it's all the wonderful people that make up the omg.lol community.

I follow way more different people too. I didn't think I'd following a wedding planner at least, heh.

It's genuinely the best social media experience I've had in a long time.

Thanks everyone. [See you soon](https://social.lol/@la).
