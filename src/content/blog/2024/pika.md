> This is mostly just a copy-paste of [this toot I made at 11pm last night](https://social.lol/@la/111722937956248582) with a little extra thrown in.

> I just want to say: THIS IS NOT A HIT PIECE or anything of the sort, I wish the Pika team the best of luck, as they're making what will become a great product. [Go sign up, if you want](https://pika.page).

### Pros

- Easy to setup - Took me less than 5 minutes from sign-up to first post.

- Default theme is nice (which is good #foreshadowing)

- RSS is featured on both blog home pages AND posts, however as there's no way to add an author name to Pika, the feed doesn't validate, according to [the W3C's feed validator](https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https://la.pika.page/posts_feed)

### Cons

- No Markdown support - There is a rich text toolbar, but no Markdown is a deal breaker for me

- Currently, no customisation.

There is currently three ways to customise a Pika blog:

- Blog Title
- Subdomain on pika.page, no custom domains yet (UPDATE 2024-01-22: Pika now lets you use custom domains when you subscribe.)
- A description box that shows up on the home of your blog

No theming, nothing. 
There used to be a theme option where you could choose between 4 preset themes, but that got removed and replaced with a [link to an update post](https://pika.pika.page/posts/we-re-removing-our-theme-option-for-now). 
As of 2024-01-09 (EN: One day after they removed the option), theming hasn't been added back yet. I'll update this post when they do.

> UPDATE (2024-01-22): Pika has readded theming!

### Ending notes
Am I switching to Pika for Concorde? Obviously not. I just spent 2 months creating this from scratch.

For other projects though, that don't need formatting though? Yeah, it's a good service, that can only get better with time. After all, they are still in Alpha.

So I'm going to keep my account around, for 2 reasons.
One, I genuinely think that this is a good service, yes even if it needs a few tweaks. 
Two, I need a place to put poetry. 
I've working on a poetry collection for a few years and have been looking for a place to post excerpts from it. 
I'll talk about it later though. You can look at it now though, it's called [Neverending](https://la.pika.page).
