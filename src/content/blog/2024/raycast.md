[Robb Knight](https://rknight.me) recently made [Three](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/raycast/)[^1] blog posts[^2] about switching to Raycast, an application launcher/Spotlight replacement/confetti machine available for MacOS.

[^1]: At the time of recording, at least.
[^2]: One of which mentions me! Thanks Robb, it's nice to be a good influence for once xD

So I thought I might as well show how I use it.

### Window Management

Every time I open an app I'm going to be using for more than 5 or so minutes I do 2 things: Add a new virtual desktop so my screen won't get cluttered with many windows, and hit `Hyper + A`, my hotkey for Almost Maximise which centres the focused window and resizes to 90% of my screen.

[^4]: By the way, I just changed my wallpaper for the first time since June last year. It's not #6768AA anymore. It's instead a collection of wallpapers from [Raycast's wallpaper pack](https://www.raycast.com/wallpapers). This is weird as hell to me but it's cute.

### Port Manager

It shows me what ports I'm using and lets me close the process that's using it.

I have this issue where VS Code sometimes persists my terminal session when I close it (or it's a skill issue)
so the dev server for this site gets stuck and when I go over to edit in Neovim, it messes up when I open the server again as it goes onto a different port.

This stops the erroneous server and I can start working.

### Spotify

### Reminders

For my to-do lists, I use Apple's built in reminders app. I wanted a quicker way to use it. So I added it to Raycast and now i can do `Control + Space` to add a new reminder to my lists, and `Hyper + R` to see them.

### Some more things I can only write a single line about

- Visual Studio Code: has a Search Recent Projects command so whenever I need to open something in VSC, I can do it in 5 seconds.
