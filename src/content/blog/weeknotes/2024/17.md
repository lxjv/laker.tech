Hello! It's been a bit since I put out a blog post (well, on purpose anyway) and I thought I'd start easy before embarking on  *Weblog Posting Month* where I and currently 13 other people try to publish a blog post a day for every day of May!

Everyone, go thank [Annie](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol) for setting this up!

(also this is the first post I've *meant* to syndicate with [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app). hi everyone)

### How I'm feeling
Not bad.

### Thoughts I've had
- Which college should I go to?
- What should I talk about in [WeblogPoMo](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024)
- Overhauling laker.tech (again) (i did it)
- Should I start a news letter again?

### Music I've listened to
- [Loyle Carter - hugo](https://song.link/https://open.spotify.com/track/3jSv1ZrTlGhFojQa7vbubm)
- [Olivia Dean - Messy](https://song.link/https://open.spotify.com/album/5YlBA1tCY0M8DDs75RB2LY)
- MF DOOM's discography
- [long drive sunday](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7y5WLmTEcuzyEVyWgTMxlR), a driving playlist i love so much that i listen to it all day
