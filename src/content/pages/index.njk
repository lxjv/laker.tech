<p>I've been creative my entire life, but started writing to clear my head, about 3 years ago.</p>

<p>
    I listen to music every second I'm awake.
    You can look at what I'm listening to over on <a href="https://last.fm/user/lxjv">Last.fm</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I'm learning a mix of <b>Rust</b> and <b>Typescript</b> right now, but I'm probably going to stick with Rust. <br>
	On the web side, I like <b>Eleventy</b> (it's what builds this site!).
</p>

<p>
    When I'm not knee-deep in my terminal, I like making music, taking photographs <br>
    and reading <strong>Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</strong> for the 5th time.
</p>

<p>
    Feel free to walk around and see what's going on.
