My up to date key is available at [https://laker.tech/.well-known/pgp](https://laker.tech/.well-known/pgp)

### Reasoning and criteria

To be honest, I haven't got the time to write down my criteria.

essentially: 2 for people i've verified over the internet, 3 for people i've verified in real life, and 4 for if I was present while the key was made.

### Keys I've signed

### Questions I don't want to answer
- I've seen your passport and it's got a different name on it?
> Laker Turner isn't my full name. I don't use my full name on the internet A) because it's an extra bit of security by obscurity B) it's nunya business thx
- If I have a different name on my passport, will you care?
> If you give me a good enough reason, no I won't.
- Why are you so lax with this?
> (hopefully) I'm not someone any government agency or hacker extraordinaire cares about. I don't particularly need to.
