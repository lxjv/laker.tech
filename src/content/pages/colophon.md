laker.tech is made with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), and hosted using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) on my VPS, [Eclipse](https://eclipse.laker.tech).

Everything was written by hand, using Neovim. I don't use AI.

The fonts around the site are all part of the **IBM Plex** family.
They are served by Bunny Fonts.

The colour-scheme is Catppuccin, either *Latte* or *Mocha* depending on whether you're in light or dark mode.

The little tree guy you might see around here was drawn by [Momo](https://heyheymomo.com).

Source code is available from [lxjv/pinto on GitHub](https://github.com/lxjv/pinto).

Don't take my blog posts though. That's rude.

### Privacy

I run a [self hosted instance](https://analytics.laker.tech/share/2xVrbvQTK4hfr5TP/laker.tech) of [Umami](https://umami.is) for analytics on this site.
If you want to block it (which is fair), you can block JS from the domain `analytics.laker.tech`
