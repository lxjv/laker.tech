laker.tech is made with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), and hosted using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) on my VPS, [Eclipse](https://eclipse.laker.tech).

Everything was written by hand, using Neovim. I don't use AI.

The font you see everywhere is **Albert Sans** and code blocks use `IBM Plex Mono`. They are served by Bunny Fonts.

The little tree guy you might see around here was drawn by [Momo](https://heyheymomo.com). My headshot was taken by me.

Source code is available from [lxjv/zeppelin on GitHub](https://github.com/lxjv/zeppelin).

Don't take my blog posts though. That's rude.

### Privacy
I run a [self hosted instance](https://analytics.laker.tech/share/2xVrbvQTK4hfr5TP/laker.tech) of [Umami](https://umami.is) for analytics on this site.
If you want to block it (which is fair), you can block JS from the domain `analytics.laker.tech`
