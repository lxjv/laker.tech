### 💜 General
- Current hyperfixations: My Neovim configuration

To quote...uhh... me, currently I'm *"functioning, not flourishing"*.

### 🏫 Education
Onto my last ever term ("semester" for americans {i think anyway}) at 6th form.

Wow, that's kind of scary.

### 💽 Music
- Last concert: Yard Act, 2024-03-17

Yard Act's new album **Where's My Utopia** is brilliant. Go listen to it.

### ✏️ Writing
Working on 2 blog posts!

### 🏳️‍⚧️ Transition
Fine. Still 6 years left on the NHS waitlist.

### 🔧 Projects
Working on a microblogging engine.

#### 🖥️ laker.tech
Made my [blogroll](/roll) more than just a Markdown list. Now it actually has Features (like not being terrible to maintain)

### 📺 Other media
I watched Dune Part 2. I'm slightly confused but it was still a good watch.
