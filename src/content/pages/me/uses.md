### Computing

#### Aestrea - Macbook Air 15'

![My laptop](https://cdn.laker.tech/dottech/aestrea.jpeg)

- specs: **16GB RAM, 1TB storage**
- accessories: Logi MX Master 3S

The thing I wrote this whole website on.

#### Cyrus - My desktop

{ I would take a photo, but both my room and cable management are terrible }

- specs: **Intel 8600K, GTX 1060 3gb, 16GB of RAM**
- OS: Debian 12

Mostly just runs Syncthing right now.

#### Lovelace - The unused rPi

{ imagine a rPI in a drawer }

It's a Raspberry Pi 4 stuck in my living room bookcase.

I'm doing nothing with it right now, I should probably do something about that.

### Software

- Terminal: iTerm2 on Aestrea, Alacritty everywhere else
- Editor: Neovim
- Font: **_BlexMono Nerd Font_**
- Colour scheme: Catppuccin Mocha (Rosewater)

- For email, I use Fastmail along with a few clients: [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org) on Cyrus, Apple Mail on Aestrea, and the Fastmail web app everywhere else.

### Tech in my pocket

- Phone: iPhone 11
- Watch: Apple Watch SE 2
- Headphones: Airpods {Pro 2, Max}

### Other things I'm a fan of

- I'm a huge fan of Field Notes notebooks and carry one in my jacket pocket everywhere I go.
- My wallet and keys are nothing special apart from my keychain has a charm of The Great Wave of Kanagawa on it.
- I either have a bag of popcorn or a roll of Polo mints on my desk at all times
